public class ParallelArrayAddition {

	//todo: Create a method which computes the sum of the first column and the first row in a 2D array.
	//For example:
	//1 2 3
	//4 5 6
	//7 8 9
	//1 + 2 + 3 = 6
	//1 + 4 + 7 = 12
	//6 + 12 = 18
	//So the result is 18.
	//For better performance use threads (or runnables) to complete this task.
	//Hint: Have a look on the SampleClass and try to understand what exactly happens there before starting with this exercise.
